I did not apply for, open, or use this account in any capacity, nor have I ever had a relationship with the creditor associated with it.

Under my rights granted by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), specifically Â§605B and Â§609(a), I request the immediate deletion of this fraudulent account from my credit profile. I have included proper identification and supporting documentation to validate my claim.

Please investigate this matter and confirm deletion in writing."""
